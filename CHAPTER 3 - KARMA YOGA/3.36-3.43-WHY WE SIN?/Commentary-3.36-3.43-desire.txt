[3.36. WHY WE SIN?]
अथ केन प्रयुक्तोऽयं पापं चरति पूरुषः।
अनिच्छन्नपि वार्ष्णेय बलादिव नियोजितः।।3.36।।
 <HIDEOUTS> Desire hides in the following hideouts within the body.
  - Outward 5 senses - Indiryas.
  - Inward 5 senses - मनो बुद्धि अहम्कार - Mind, Intellect and the sense of कर्ता
  - These abodes are autonomous by themselves and have their own local intelligences. They decide of their own and pull in different directions as the @horses of a chariot.

  In verse 3.36 (Chapter 3, verse 36) Arjuna asks Krishna - Ok i got that there is this way that if i take will lead me to sorrow. I know now the path of selfishness, the path of attraction and attachment with worldly things are bad for me and will give me pain in long run. But then what is that O Krishna, that impels me to do the same thing over and over again, even unwillingly. He asks, "Impelled by what does a man commit this evil, unwillingly even! It is as if it is urged by a force. What is that force?

[3.37 DESIRE IS THE ROOT CAUSE OF ALL SORROW]
  In @3.37, Krishna says the seed of all the force that impells people to continue the path of sorrow even knowingly that it is harmful for them is desire. This desire transforms into anger when the object of desire is not met. This same desire transfoms into fear when one is powerless. This same desire transforms into anxiety when there is an apprehension of loss of the object.

[3.38, 3.39 DESIRE OBSCURES] Krishna continues to say that like smoke hides the fire, dust obscures the mirror, and an embryo is enveloped in the womb, this desire covers the real self of the person. That pure self of bliss and freedom and existence. That is hidden.
In 3.39 Krishna says that even for a Gyani this desire destroys him like an eternal fire. There is no end to it. More one desire more one wants. We never get satisfied.

Having root caused that desire is the source of every malady, Krishna goes further to explain where these desires hide out and stay in 3.39. Krishna says that these desires are hidden deep inside our 5 external sense organs (indriyas) , our mind (manah)  and our intellect (buddhi). The desire stays in these tools that humans posses, and they obscure her true self
  [10:45 PM, 6/27/2020] Samrat Kar: This he continues in 3.39 to 3.40
  [10:46 PM, 6/27/2020] Samrat Kar: By end of 3.40 following understsanding have been accomplished -
  1. Desires are root cause of all sorrow
  2. Desires reside in sense organs, mind and intellect
  In 3.40 to 3.43 he starts giving systematic method to kill this desire.
  [10:53 PM, 6/27/2020] Samrat Kar: In these 4 verses, he says the following -
  1. 3.41 - Start from the easy cause. Start from the 5 external sense organs. Restrain the senses first. This is done by sadhana, satsang, and seva. This is done by daily discipline. By not allowing senses to indulge on anything that might be slippery.
  2. 3.42 - These hideouts of desire have a natural hierarchy within them. The one higher up can control the lower ones. And the one higher up is closer to our self and is freer from the world out there. Sense organs are superior to worldly objects of desire. Mind is superior to sense organs. Intellect is superior to mind. and then our real self - the consiousness witness - Satchitananda - is superior to the intellect. If we realize that and be focused on the real self, slowly slowly all the lower abode of desires melt away
  [10:53 PM, 6/27/2020] Samrat Kar: So from 3.36 to 3.43 - you have a graphic illustration to your question
